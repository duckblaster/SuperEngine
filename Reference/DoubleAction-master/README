ACTION BOOGALOO SOURCE CODE


Follow development of this project here: http://forums.digitanks.com/viewtopic.php?f=16


How to build it:

1. You need Visual Studio 2010 Express. You also need Git. TortoiseGit will do. You then need to download the Source SDK Base 2007 from Steam.
2. Use TortoiseGit to download the source to your hard drive.
3. Make sure that you have the latest testing build installed in \source\steamapps\sourcemods\actionboogaloo
4. Open the project file.
5. Right click on "Client SDK" and tell it "Set startup project". This specifies which project in your solution that Visual Studio will try to run when you hit F5. 
6. Right click "Client SDK" and go to properties. Then go to "Debugging" Set "Configuration" (at the top) to "Debug" Set the following variables:

Command: C:\Steam\steamapps\yourusername\source sdk base 2007\hl2.exe
Command arguments: -allowdebug -dev -sw -game "C:\Steam\SteamApps\SourceMods\actionboogaloo"
Working directory: C:\Steam\steamapps\yourusername\source sdk base 2007

You may need to modify these to point to your Steam directory.
7. Verify that the "Custom build step" also points to your correct Steam directory.
8. Right click on "Solution" in the Solution explorer and choose "Configuration Manager" and set that to "Debug"
9. Press F7 to build it. This takes a while.
10. Press F5 to run it.

Hopefully everything will work and you will be in the debugger running the game. Load up a map and have at it.
